# Script status sender
### Just an easy way to get notified via telegram when your script does something interesting/finishes.

I needed some script to send me some messages while/after my script finished. I read some stackoverflow questions and search for some code, here you have what i ended coding and periodically using!

Since my first purpose was only to send text I have some functions for it. After that I modified the script to send a full summary about my neural network's training. 

Made with python and [python-telegram-bot library.](https://github.com/python-telegram-bot)

## Files
- [File functions.py](./functions.py)
 contains a very easy way to send text and photos (customize them!)
- [Neural_Network_trainig_functions.py](./neural_network_training_summary.py)
 contains one of the reasons why i create this script: to send a complete summary about your artificial neural network training. It sends: the time spent, variables, acc, loss, acc graph, loss_graph
- [example with time.py](./example_with_time.py)
 contains an easy way to use the functions to print total time spent
